My role involved executing automation scripts in Python and MySQL to process address and street data, ensuring accuracy and completeness. I contributed to improving geocoding precision, modernizing unnamed geometries, and enhancing routing by defining road hierarchies and grade separation codes. This experience gave me strong exposure to automation, scripting, and data validation — skills that later became foundational in my transition to DevOps engineering."
